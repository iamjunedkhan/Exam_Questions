      <p class="text-xl">
        Roaming is a service offered by mobile network operators (MNOs) that
        allows their customers to use their mobile devices, such as smartphones
        or tablets, while traveling outside of their home network coverage area.
        When a mobile device user travels to an area outside of their home
        network coverage, the device will automatically search for and connect
        to a compatible network within the roaming partner network of their MNO.
        This enables the device user to continue to use their device to make and
        receive calls, send and receive text messages, and access the Internet,
        as if they were still in their home network coverage area. The MNO
        typically charges the user for the use of the network services while
        roaming, often at higher rates than those charged for home network
        usage, due to the costs associated with providing access to the partner
        network. Roaming is particularly useful for travelers who need to stay
        connected to the Internet and communicate with others while traveling
        outside of their home network coverage area. However, users should be
        aware of the potential for higher charges and may wish to check with
        their MNO to understand the specific rates and charges associated with
        roaming before using their devices while traveling.
